/**
 * A Spine texture page uploaded PREMULTIPLIED, whatever the file holds, so every skeleton is drawn
 * with premultipliedAlpha = true (drawSkeleton(skeleton, true)).
 *
 * Why: spine-ts 3.8's WebGL blend table writes Screen as (ONE, ONE_MINUS_SRC_ALPHA) and Multiply
 * as (DST_COLOR, ONE_MINUS_SRC_ALPHA) for either kind of texture -- both assume premultiplied
 * colour. Many of the game's chibi and artwork pages are straight alpha, and keep colour in their
 * fully transparent pixels. Drawn straight, a Screen slot paints that colour too: Mudrock's
 * Silent Night DN06 candle light (slot F_Light_01) drew as a solid yellow blob with jagged edges
 * (2026-10-20). Premultiplied, those pixels are nothing, as in the game; Normal and Additive slots
 * look the same either way.
 *
 * The flag is set around every upload, including the one a lost-and-restored WebGL context makes
 * (GLTexture.restore calls update), and put back after, so no other texture is affected.
 * tests/spine-premultiplied.test.mjs holds every skeleton renderer to this.
